            <div class="col span_3_of_3">
                Luke comes from the old school way of shaping using his electric planers, hand tools and templates to
                handcraft each individual board to the highest possible degree of accuracy, though in the past few years
                he has enlisted the help of the APS profiling machine to help out when the work load gets heavy but also
                to maintain consistency when shaping highly refined models which have taken years to perfect but the
                vast majority of custom boards are still hand shaped from start to finish.
                Only first quality foam is used so that desired weights and strength characteristics are achieved for
                each model of board for each customer.
                *Note: profiling machines are only there to reduce the donkey work for the shaper. A reputable,
                skilled craftsman is still required to finish the blank to the perfect finished board*

            <div class="col span_3_of_3">
                All of our boards are glassed on site under temperature controlled conditions. This achieves consistency
                and produces the clearest, smoothest, hardest, most air free glass job available using Norsodyne resin
                and hexcel fibreglass fabric.
                For mals and retro boards a full range of resin tints are available.

                <p>All boards are sanded to a wet and dry 400grit finish to give a smooth, silky lustre by Alex Manning.
                    Alex's finishing skills are second to none, right from the perfection of the resin finish to the
                    razor sharp bead edges around the tail of the boards which he painstakingly adds every time. With
                    his background in luxury yachts and with a little help from Luke his finishing truly represents the
                    quality of LY surfboards... not to mention the clarity of his gloss polishing.</p>
