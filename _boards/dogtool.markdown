With the standards of high performance surfing ever increasing, we spent this year carefully working on our brand new performance shortboard - the dog tool.
We've drawn the rail line slightly straighter around the mid part of the board ever so slightly increasing nose and tail width and creating a faster, straighter plan shape.
With a deep single concave throughout and increased tail lift, the dogtool is the perfect vehicle for today and tomorrow's ripping.
