---
A modern take on the 70's 'Displacement Hull' style of board, with pinched 50/50 rails, huge rolling 's' deck and two plus one set up including all glass hull flex fin.
The original boards were rolled vee throughout, we still offer this but also offer a slight concave version making the board a little more lively in slacker surf.  We also offer the Hullster in larger, more narrow dimensions for larger heavier surf, with pulled in tail and stinger wings.  Please call to discuss your needs for a spacific wave type.
We highly recommend this board to any retro enthusiast or anyone fancying something different for summer fun.
