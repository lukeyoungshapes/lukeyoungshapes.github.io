Available as a winged swallow tail with quad fin set up, or rounded pin 5 fin convertable, the vulcan favours the heavier surfer in smaller, weaker surf. super low nose entry with natural mid to tail rocker allows the vulcan to perform better than the standard fish design, with a deep single concave through to slight double in the fins flowing out into a light vee in the tail to aid the wide vulcan move from rail to rail. Extremely full deck volume gives the vulcan the most possible bouyancy without compromising performance.
