Our latest edition to 2016... 'The Mako' is now available...
A follow up to our popular new 'Meteor' model the Mako is more shortboard in plan shape with a rounded diamond tail.
The 'hip' in the tail is brought forward to 16" to widen the area directly below your centre of gravity when turning and to maintain a sensibly wider tail section.
The deep 4 channel bottom and low, sharp rear rails add drive and grip in surf from 2-6 ft.
The mako can be ordered shorter and wider for slacker surf or as standard shortboard dimensions.
