The Paipo is a modern day take on the belly board ridden by early polynesians traditionally built from Breadfruit or Koa wood. This is where the Bodyboard comes from today... we believe the Paipo is faster due to its rigidity and twin fin set up than the bodyboard and looks a hell of a lot cooler with extras such as resin tints and custom paint work!
