The Robot has been reborn! All the fun of the original robot, with a slightly narrower tail and a full concave through the length of the board. Its a high performance super-shortboard for the smallest, mushiest, crapiest waves ridable. The idea behind this crazy looking board is to offer the best performance in the weakest waves. Still pretty wide in the tail with really low rocker for the most possible speed through planing area and reduced drag. The Robot has an extremely deep single concave and now comes with twin fin sides and a g3 or g5 trailing fin, with 8 degrees of fin cant in the front fins for increased lift. Order your Robot up to 8 inches shorter than your standard board, 1 inch wider and the same thickness.
Prepare to be stared at. woot!!!!
