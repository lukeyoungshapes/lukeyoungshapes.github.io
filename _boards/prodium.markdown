New for 2017

Our new high performance shortboard replacing the dogtool model for experienced through to pro surfers.

A continuous nose to tail rocker curve allows for tight, vertical pocket surfing in good quality waves.

The Prodium has a deep single mid, to sunk double concave through the fin cluster adding a little more drive and control, coupled with a low mid rail through to foiled aft rail for grip and drive.
