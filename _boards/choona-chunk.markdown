Small wave twinnie with trailer option. Really fun, really fast with straight aft rails into tiny wings and a diamond tail. This elliminates the usual problems with wide tailed, winged twins at higher speeds or on your backhand. Slight single concave into pannel vee for increased lift and control through the tail.
