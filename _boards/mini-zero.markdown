The mini zero is an adapted version of my popular zero shortboard model for small or weak surf. The length is reduced by four inches, the entry rocker is lowered right down and the width is increased by half an inch, but you still ride the same thickness. This allows you to paddle into waves really early and once into them fly through flat spots with ease. The mini zero has a deep single concave running right through with a thruster fin set up and your choice or round or rounded square tail.
