Moving forward with board design, we took the cyber-charger which we designed a few years ago and refined its outline and rocker so it performs better in many more conditions than just bigger, hollower waves, and here it is... The Supercharger.  As we got so used to riding the flatter rockered boards even in good surf, hopping back to a conventional shortboard with heaps of rocker just wasnt the same. We've kept the nose width and entry rocker of the cyborg/minizero and added a rounded pin tail/mini swallow with a sleeker rail curve in the rear half. We've theortically stuck the nose half of an easy paddling groveller board to the tail section of a 'step up' board for a 'two in one' feel.  By moving the wide point of the board two inches forward wave catching is made easy and its therefore possible to be riding bigger waves on a much smaller board, however due to the refining for 2013 the supercharger can also be used as an allrounder if ordered slightly shorter and wider.  The supercharger comes with a 5 fin convertable fin set up and a single concave right through.
