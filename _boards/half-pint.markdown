Super-grom performance model, we took into account the difficulties of low paddle power and low body weight experienced by feather-weight surfers and designed the half pint with today's standards of performance surfing in mind.
Low entry rocker, pinched rails, hidden chest/mid volume and our own mini fin cluster set up come together to fast track the next generation... Look out, here they come!!!
