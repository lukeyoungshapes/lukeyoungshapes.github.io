New for 2016, the fastest surfboard in our small wave range has come crashing to earth!!!
We created a performance fish outline with wing and shallow swallow tail to maximize planing area, coupled it with a deep single to sunk double concave through the fin area for increased lift. 
The Meteor has a very low entry rocker to increase paddle speed and also give you early entry into waves.
We've rolled the deck, pinched the rails and especially foiled the aft rail (through the tail) for increased drive and grip through high speed turns, this will also allow greater flex/spring in the tail. 
We tried and tested the Meteor over nine months and concluded that it was equally as good as a quad, thruster, or quad plus 'knubster/TMF' fin.
The dimension/volume breakdown is merely a guide to sizing, Meteors can be ordered shorter/wider as a small/slack wave groveler or slightly longer/narrower as more of an all rounder for surf up to 4-5 feet.
