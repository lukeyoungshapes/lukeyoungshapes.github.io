We created a performance fish outline with wing and shallow swallow tail to maximize planing area, coupled it with a deep single to sunk double concave through the fin area for increased lift. 
The Meteor has a very low entry rocker to increase paddle speed and also give you early entry into waves.

We've rolled the deck, pinched the rails and especially foiled the aft rail (through the tail) for increased drive and grip through high speed turns, this will also allow greater flex/spring in the tail. 

The Meteor has been tried and tested in the past two years with a range of different fin set ups and is equally as fun as a thruster, quad, quad plus ‘knubster/TMF’, twin fin and more recently twin fin or thruster with channels.

Please call for more info on the merits of each fin/channel set up.

The dimension/volume breakdown is merely a guide to sizing, Meteors can be ordered shorter/wider as a small/slack wave groveler or slightly longer/narrower as more of an all rounder for surf up to 4-5 feet.
