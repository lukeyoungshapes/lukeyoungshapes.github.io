Small to medium sized surf shortboard. A follow on from the popular Robot, the Cyborg features a more shortboard plan shape, with domed deck and pinched rails over a very low rocker. Single to double concave, with the single pulled out towards the rail giving a harder release and double cvoncave extending right through and out the back of the tail. The Cyborg can be ridden in a wider range of surf than the Robot and its rail to rail surfing abilities exceed that of the robot for punchier winter surf. Order 2 to 3 inches shorter than your standard shortboard, and 3/4" to 1" wider with same thickness.
