Multi purpose SUP which comes equipped with integral inserts with marine grade steel screws for an elastic cargo net, detachable fishing rod holder/rest, drinks bottle cages and mini anchor.
The Aquaman is perfect for flat water paddling, rod fishing, snorkelling/spear fishing and also has a low to natural rocker through to the tail so can be used for surfing in small to medium conditions.
Constructed from stringered eps and laminated with tinted epoxy the Aquaman is kept nice and light but maintains strength with the skills of onsite panic box finishing.
