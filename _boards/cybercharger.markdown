Building on the success of my cyborg model the past two summers we've given birth to the cyber-charger for bigger, hollower waves. We got so used to riding the flatter rockered boards even in good surf that hopping back to a conventional shortboard with heaps of rocker just wasnt the same. We've kept the nose width and rocker of the cyborg and added a rounded pin tail with a sleeker rail curve in the rear half. By upping the length by two to three inches from the cyborg its possible to be riding bigger waves on a much smaller board due to the low nose entry. The cyber-charger comes with a 5 fin convertable fin set up.
