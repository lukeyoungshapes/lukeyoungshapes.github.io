High performance shortboard for week to medium powered waves, the inchpincher combines key elements from our very popular 'Robot' and 'Minizero' models formulating our new weapon. Inchpincher has a fuller nose shape than the minizero but not as round as the robot reducing the risk of forward rail catching during vertical surfing, the wide rounded square tail and deep single concave maximise lift and speed. We designed it slightly longer than your usual 'summer plug' to maintain a longer rail line for greater down the line speed. We've pinched the rails throughout to increase drive and control, plus increased the lift in the tail rocker to draw out rail turns at high speed. The inchpincher should be ridden 4-5 inches shorter than your standard shortboard and a half inch wider with the same thickness (for example 65kg surfer, standard shortboard 6'1 x 18 1/4" x 2 1/4", typical Inchpincher dims 5'8 x 18 3/4" x 2 1/4") Can be ordered as a thruster, quad or 5 fin convertible fin set up with FCS or Lokbox fin systems.
