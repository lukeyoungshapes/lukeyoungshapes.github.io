Tow board with design influences taken from the Cyborg surfboard. Narrowed tail plan shape and quad fin design holds the board in the water at high speeds. Low rocker throughout, rolled vee through the nose to break up surface chop, into single concave through to double running through the fins and out the tail, increasing drive and control. Super solid construction with fitted Chinook strap inserts. Order in high density foam with over-sized stringer and your own foot strap insert configuration.
