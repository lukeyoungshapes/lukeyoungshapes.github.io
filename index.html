                At LY Surfboards we appreciate that no two surfers are the same, that's why we have such a diverse range of models to cater for any style or ability - from
                beginners boards right through to big guns and tow boards. Even though we use models we are still a 'custom surfboards' business. We tailor every board to each
                individual customers requirements- also if a customer has an idea of their own we're more than happy to build it for them.
                With the combination of only the most premium quality materials, second to none craftsmanship and the best possible customer care, we strive for the ultimate
                service.

                Now in his late 30s, Luke has over 20 years of "off the blank" specialist shaping under his belt. This
                experience has lead to highly refined rocker lines, concaves and overall foils of his custom surfboards.
                All shapes are field tested by the shaper himself as well as team riders in national and international
                conditions.

                All abilities and tastes catered for from high performance shortboards to ten foot triple stringer mals,
                twin fin retro boards to travel boards and tow boards. You name it, we can provide it to the highest
                possible quality and performance.
                Machine profile programs are also available to replicate that magic board

                Luke has been shaping with Brian Bulkley (Bulkley surfboards, Lost surfboards), Hawaii's legendary gun
                shaper Pat Rawson (Rawson Surfboards Hawaii) and more recently Rob Vaughan of Billabong surfboards
                Europe.
