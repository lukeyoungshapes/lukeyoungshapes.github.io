                Now in his early 30s, Luke has over 15 years of "off the blank" specialist shaping under his belt. This experience has lead to highly refined rocker lines, concaves and overall foils of his custom surfboards.
                All shapes are field tested by the shaper himself as well as team riders in national and international conditions.

                All abilities and tastes catered for from high performance shortboards to ten foot triple stringer mals, twin fin retro boards to travel boards and tow boards. You name it, we can provide it to the highest possible quality and performance.
                Machine profile programs are also available to replicate that magic board

                Luke has been shaping with Brian Bulkley (Bulkley surfboards, Lost surfboards), Hawaii's legendary gun shaper Pat Rawson (Rawson Surfboards Hawaii) and more recently Rob Vaughan of Billabong surfboards Europe.
