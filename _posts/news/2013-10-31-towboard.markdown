Luke was recently contacted by Hammer and Thresher to make a towboard for Irelands (South Africas) Barry Mottershead to take to shipsterns bluff, Tasmania. Barry has been charging mullaghmore and is up for a bit of southern hemisphere juice, so he's turned to Luke to shape him a board that can handle the big stuff. Luke has been working with Pat Rawson for the past few years, so he's been able to use Pat's invaluable experience to help with this request to ensure that Bazza gets the perfect board
